# Getting Started

1. **Join the disaster-response-sj Slack channel** to introduce yourself and meet contributors [https://codeforsanjose.slack.com/messages/disaster-response-sj](https://codeforsanjose.slack.com/messages/disaster-response-sj)
2. **Browse issues** posted on the disaster-response-sj repository on GitHub for some contribution ideas [https://github.com/codeforsanjose/disaster-response-sj/issues](https://github.com/codeforsanjose/disaster-response-sj/issues)
3. **Clone [the *develop* branch](https://github.com/codeforsanjose/disaster-response-sj/tree/develop)** of the disaster-response-sj repository from GitHub onto your computer. The main files to work on will be in the `src` directory.
4. **Run the webapp** (refer to setup & installation), click around, and explore the different features. Any bugs to fix? Anything to improve? Features to add? Documentation to update?
5. **Report issues** or assign yourself an existing issue/notify others if you want to work on something so others can keep track of who's doing what.

If you've never used GitHub before, here's a [Git/GitHub tutorial to help you get started](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWYqp7iY_Tc).

# Installation

You'll need to setup the frontend (the interface you interact with on the browser) and the backend (the mock server containing disaster data) before you can run the web app.

## Prerequisites

* Updated versions of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm), and [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed. Check node/npm versions in a command window with `node -v` and `npm -v`
* Tested as working with npm v6.4.1 and Node.js v10.15.1.
* Updated [Python version >= 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Check Python version with `python`
* Windows users may need additional setup. See Troubleshooting section for help.

## Setup

You'll need to run the following on the command line.

1. **Clone the repository**
`git clone https://github.com/codeforsanjose/disaster-response-sj.git`. This should download the project to your computer in a directory called disaster-response-sj.
2. **Change to the *develop* branch**
`git checkout develop` while in the disaster-response sj directory.
3. **Install dependencies**
`npm i`. These are programs and files the project requires to run.
4. **Install nodemon**
`npm i nodemon -g`. This restarts the server whenever you make changes to the code.
5. **Ask for database credentials file** `projectInfoData.js` from project lead on disaster-response-sj Slack channel or click: [https://codeforsanjose.slack.com/archives/C77546YF6/p1555038461000900](https://codeforsanjose.slack.com/archives/C77546YF6/p1555038461000900)
6. **Move downloaded `projectInfoData.js` into `config`** directory in your disaster-response-sj repo to enable the back end.

Issues installing? See [Troubleshooting section](#troubleshooting).

# Usage and Running the App

## Easy way:

1. `npm run all` should start the backend and frontend, then automatically open a tab in your web browser with the web app. If the tab doesn't open, you can manually enter [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the app.

## Manual way:

1. **Start the server** `nodemon --exec babel-node server.js` or alternatively `npm run server`.
 Let it finish launching before starting the frontend. Manually restart the server with the comand `rs`
2. **Start the React frontend** `npm start`.
You'll need to do this in another command window.

## Ready to Work?

Skip ahead to the [Development Details section.](#development-details)

`npm run all` is just an alias to run the manual commands. If on Windows and that command doesn't work, you can try `npm run win-all`. To stop running the app, you can hit Ctrl + C in a Windows command prompt and it'll ask to terminate running jobs.

Either way, you should land on the main page showing active disaster posts with tab navigation options and a header reading Disaster Response SJ.

This part of the app is aimed at public citizens.

## Creating a Disaster Post

You can create disaster posts or update existing disaster posts from the administrative part of the app, which requires a login. You might also want to do development on this part of the app.

To access, go to [http://localhost:3000/login](http://localhost:3000/login)

You will need a username and password to login to the admin area. Contact the project lead for the login credentials: [https://codeforsanjose.slack.com/messages/disaster-response-sj](https://codeforsanjose.slack.com/messages/disaster-response-sj)

This part of the app is aimed at government employees.

# Troubleshooting

Some developers may run into issues installing and running the app on their local machine. There have been some reported issues getting the app to run on Windows.

A long thread containing information on the issues [can be found here](https://github.com/codeforsanjose/disaster-response-sj/issues/43).

## Extended Setup & Run Guide (Windows)

Run the following as an administrator. Any command line windows should be specifically ran as an administrator.

1. Clone the disaster-response-sj repository `git clone https://github.com/codeforsanjose/disaster-response-sj.git`
2. Install latest version of Node.js and NPM
3. Install latest version of Python (maybe unnecessary because Python is installed as part of windows-build-tools)
4. Install Windows Build Tools globally: `npm install -g --production windows-build-tools@4.0.0`
5. Install bcrypt manually (make sure you're in the project directory): `npm install bcrypt --save`
6. Install react manually (make sure you're in the project directory): `npm install react --save`
7. Install app dependencies: `npm i`
8. Install Nodemon globally: `npm install -g nodemon`
9. Install Babel globally: `npm install -g @babel/core @babel/cli @babel/node`
10. Ask project lead for the database credentials file on Slack, download it, and put it in the /config directory of the project. This link should take you to the file: [https://codeforsanjose.slack.com/archives/C77546YF6/p1555038461000900](https://codeforsanjose.slack.com/archives/C77546YF6/p1555038461000900)
11. Change to the **develop** branch `git checkout develop` in the disaster-response sj directory.
12. Start the back end server: `nodemon --exec babel-node server.js` while in project directory
13. Start the front end React app (open another command prompt window): `npm start`

## Additional Troubleshooting Tips

* You may have to restart your computer or run commands a second time. Verify packages are actually installed by using `npm list <package name to check>` to see if they show up.
* If you encounter an error running nodemon and close your command window to try again, sometimes the node process won't be terminated and you'll get an error if you try to start nodemon again. Just go to task manager and kill any node.js processes.
* If you get an error about a missing module, you might have to update the project dependencies again, especially if you haven't kept the project directory up to date. Just do an `npm i` again
* To quit running the app, hit Ctrl + C in your command window and it'll ask you if you want to terminate the batch job. Type Y and hit enter, and it'll stop the running process. You can do that in both windows to stop the front and back end.

# Contact and Help

Questions? Reach out to the project team on the #disaster-response-sj Slack channel [https://codeforsanjose.slack.com/messages/disaster-response-sj](https://codeforsanjose.slack.com/messages/disaster-response-sj)

Running this web app and working on it assumes some level of command line knowledge, familiarity with git, and using npm. If you're unfamiliar with this, you may want to review some web development resources. You can also ask for some guidance from other contributors.

## Team

Project Leader:
* Joseph, reachable on the [Code for San Jose Slack](https://codeforsanjose.slack.com/messages/disaster-response-sj) as @joester

# Background

## Goals

Inspired by civic tech volunteer responses to hurricanes Harvey and Irma,
the goal of the disaster-response-sj project is to engage with San Jose's
Office of Emergency Services to discuss how Code for San Jose can contribute to
disaster response and planning.

## Target Users

1. **Citizens** - Any range of citizen from young, elderly, disabled, and speaking other languages. These users will read active disaster info and disaster planning resources.
2. **Government Disaster Response Employees** - These are the government employees responsible for disaster response using the administrative parts of the app to create and update disaster information posts for publication.

# Developer Documentation

## Code Guidelines

* Add comments if necessary, but try to write readable code
* Be a fan of [functional programming](https://medium.com/the-renaissance-developer/concepts-of-functional-programming-in-javascript-6bc84220d2aa)
* [Keep code organized](https://itnext.io/rethinking-separation-of-concerns-with-react-7e5de1b5c0f7) and try to [separate your concerns](https://krasimirtsonev.com/blog/article/react-separation-of-concerns)

## How to Contribute

If you aren't sure how your skills can support the project, talk to other contributors and they can help you find suitable work.

Ask to be added as a collaborator to the disaster-response-sj repo if you want to add branches on the main repo. You'll need to provide your GitHub name.

### Forking

Many contributors will just clone the main repo to their local machine for development instead of forking.

It's more complicated to manage than pushing branches directly to the main repo, but if you want your own copy of the main repo on GitHub under your GitHub account, you can fork it. It's more effort in syncing updates/making pull requests, but you get full control over your own forked repo. You can also create a pull request right away without waiting to be added as a collaborator.

### Contribution Process & Workflow

1. **Assign issue** to yourself and notify team of what you'll work on.
2. **Create a new branch** for the feature you will be working on from the `develop` branch: `git checkout develop` then `git checkout -b name-of-your-new-branch-here`.
3. **Commit changes** to your feature branch then push it to the repo: `git push origin name-of-the-branch`.
4. **Create a pull request** on GitHub for merging your feature branch with the `develop` branch so it can be reviewed by team members. Share it in the Slack channel.
5. **Project lead will merge changes** in your branch into the `develop` branch if everything looks good

### Keeping Your Branch in Sync: Rebasing

Sometimes you'll work on a feature branch for a while and during that time someone else will merge updates into the main develop branch of the GitHub repo. The local copy of the develop branch on your computer won't be updated with those changes. When you already have several commits and go to create a pull request to merge your changes into the main repository, it's more likely you'll have merge conflicts to resolve.

You can prevent those conflicts by first merging in the updated version of the main repository with your local copy before you create a pull request.

There's 2 ways to do this: [by merging or by rebasing.](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/merging-vs-rebasing)

* **Merging** adds a new commit to your history just for merging the updates into your branch
* **Rebasing** adds all the updates then replays your commits after those updates, without creating a new commit

Rebasing can help preserve a cleaner commit history for a project. For example, if you and a dev named Jane added commits to the develop branch, rebasing is like adding your changes on top of what John has already done.

To rebase:

```
// gets the upstream changes from the origin
git fetch
// switch to your feature branch if not already on it
git checkout your-feature-branch-name
// rebases changes from the origin develop branch onto the local develop branch
git rebase origin/develop
```

If you forked the repo, you'll also need to push the new develop branch to your fork before creating your pull request `git push -f fork-origin-name-here develop`

## Project Structure

You'll do most frontend interface development work in the `/src` directory. Backend development work can be done in the `/backend` directory and `server.js`

The React app is organized into 3 general categories of interface blocks inspired by the [Atomic Design philosophy](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/):

1. **Components** - Most reusable react components, aka atoms in atomic design
2. **Compositions** - More specific components that will have some reusable components, aka molecules in atomic design
3. **Containers** - Made of compositional components and other reusable components, aka organisms in atomic design

You'll notice each type of block is in a separate directory containing a css file, a js file, and a test.js file. If you want to apply styles just to a single block, you can add styles to the css file. This makes the styles more modular and specific to the component they apply to. The js files will contain all the logic and rendering for the interface. Some files and directories are denoted as markup. These contain detailed HTML elements for JSX render functions to use.

There are also:

* Contexts - Things for state management that can replace redux
* Utilities - Stateless functions to be used generally in several places

## React Style & Hooks

This project uses React hooks, which is a newer, cleaner way of writing a React app versus the more traditional class style.

Here's an example of equivalent components written in each style:

```javascript
// React Hooks style
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Example() {
  // Declare a new state variable, which we'll call "count"
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}

// React Classes style
class Example extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      count: 0
    };
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>You clicked {this.state.count} times</p>
        <button onClick={() => this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 })}>
          Click me
        </button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

* [https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html)

## Libraries & Tools

* [Leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/) - Used for easy Open Street Maps integration for displaying maps
* [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) - Used for unit testing
* [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) - Used for initial scaffolding of the app so you can expect all the basics that comes with it like webpack, babel, and autoprefixer

### San Jose

via @mthong:

  [City Council video and documentation](http://sanjose.granicus.com/MediaPlayer.php?view_id=51&clip_id=9856)

  Agenda items 3.5, 3.6 and 3.7 all relate to the flood response and future emergency management. I’d specifically recommend watching/listening to the City staff presentation and public comment (go to item 3.5 in the video index), or reading the staff memo for item 3.6.


See particularly Sec. 3.6 Memorandum; it's 130 pages total (!!) but the TL;DR is Appendix B and C.
