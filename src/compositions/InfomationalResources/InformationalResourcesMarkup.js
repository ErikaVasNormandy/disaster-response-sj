      <h2>Get a Kit</h2>
      <p>The emergency supplies in a basic disaster readiness kit can help you keep alive. Think first about essentials like food, water, shelter, and clean air. Also keep in mind how you will receive information during a disaster.</p>
      <aside>
        Protip: Aim for at least 3 days worth of supplies for your household. Consider 2 kits--one for the house and one portable if you need to leave.
